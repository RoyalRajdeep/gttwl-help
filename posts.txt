MARKING AS OPENED IN AN EMAIL
=============================

Most kinds of public posts (blogs, products, etc) should be marked as opened. 
We have a special attribute to deal with this:
{{open_link}}

In an email:
<img src="{{post.open_link}}" height="1" width="1" />

The on-page analytics already takes care of this automatically on web pages.
