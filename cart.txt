CART
====

The cart features implements shopping cart management and checkout. Carts can hold any kind of post which contains a price.

The cart is simple and functions according to the following workflow:

1. Add an item to the cart
2. Add more items (if needed)
3. View the cart
4. Update items in the cart
5. Checkout

ADD TO CART
-----------
Add an item to the cart with this URL

Endpoint:
/cart/update

Parameters:
* zid (required. ZID of product/post to add to cart)
* quantity (optional, 0-9999)

Adding a quantity of 0 will remove the item from the cart.

UPDATE QUANTITY IN CART
-----------------------
This is the same as adding an item to the cart. You will enter the new quantity required.
Adding a quantity of zero (0) will remove the item from the cart

VIEW CART
---------
You will need to create a page that shows items in the cart. (We have created a stub page you can use for functionality).

Page URL:
/cart

Liquid variables available:

* cart.id (id of this cart)
* cart.items (list of items in cart. Includes "quantity" and "total" variables as well.)
* cart.subtotal (total of prices in cart)
* cart.taxes (total of taxes)
* cart.tax_rate (current tax rate)
* cart.total (grand total)

HTML to add item to the cart from a product page:

<form method="POST" action="/cart/update">
  <input type="number" name="quantity" value="1" />
  <input type="hidden" name="zid" value="{{product.zid}}" />
  <button>Add to Cart</button>
  
  <!-- We can add a return URL. Default returns to /cart -->
  <!-- <input type="text" name="return_url" value="/checkout" /> -->
</form>


ITEMS IN CART
-------------
You can show the number of items in the cart on any page with the following Liquid variable:

* cart_quantity

CHECKING OUT
------------
Once the cart is updated correctly, you can hit the checkout URL.
This should be a secure URL, and is available in the following liquid variable

(Please note that sites should setup a secure cname to make this work)

* cart_checkout_url

You also need to create a checkout page with the following URL:
(A stub page is already created that you can build on.)

/cart/checkout


THANK YOU PAGE
--------------

Once a checkout is successful, the purchaser is redirected to the thank-you page:

/cart/thanks

You will need to create this page with the above URL.
(A stub page is already created that you can build on.)

This page implements a receipt/invoice of the items purchased.
