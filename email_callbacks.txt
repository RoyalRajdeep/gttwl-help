EMAIL CALLBACKS
===============

We can fire off emails when certain events occur.

Of course you have to have the email templates created at first. 
These templates are liquid templates just like the rest of the pages on your site.

NEW CONTENT CALLBACKS
=====================

When you use the "/api/post/create" handler to create a new post, 
you can setup several kinds of callbacks that will send an email 
to the user who created the post.

email-:kind-after-create

Example:
email-blog-after-create
email-question-after-create

This works with all the kinds of posts that we support creating. 
An example is if you need to send a confirmation email to the author of the post.

Besides the usual template tags available in the template for the post you created, 
we also make available 3 other special template tags:

* approve_url - a url to click to approve the post
* disable_url - a url to click to set the post to draft
* delete_url - a url to delete the post


NEW USER CALLBACKS
==================

When a new user signs up with any method through the site, 
we will send any of these emails to the user:

email-after-signup:
Can be used to send a confirmation or welcome email. 
You will have available the special liquid variable "confirm_url" which when clicked,
will confirm the user account.

email-after-signup-confirm:
Triggered when the user confirms their email address. 
Great to show a welcome message.


GENERIC CALLBACKS
=================

You can also send any kind of generic email when a new post is created using the /api/post/create endpoint.

Step 1:
Create a hidden field in your form called "notify"

Step 2:
Create an email template (in the page editor) and remember its url. Example "email-foo-bar"

Step 3:
In your form, the value of the "notify" field should be the same name of your email template. As in above example 2. "email-foo-bar"

Implementation:
<input type="hidden" name="notify" value="email-foo-bar">

Your email template will contain all the liquid variables typically available in any kind of post (See that documentation).
