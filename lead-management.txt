LEAD MANAGEMENT
===============

When a new lead (or trip) is created, we perform a few actions

Agent Notification
------------------
An agent (or the agency) is notified about the lead. 
To override this email, create/edit a new email template 
with the url: "email-travel-lead"

Customer Welcome
----------------
We also send a thank-you email to the customer.
To override thsi email, create/edit a new email template
with the url: "email-new-trip"

Additionally, we create new actions to occur in the customer's feed in the admin.
