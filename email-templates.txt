EMAIL TEMPLATES
----------------

Email templates and layouts mirror the system used for web templates in general. All emails should be in HTML.

Layouts
-------
The default layout name for emails is "email-layout".
Just design your layout as you would any html layout and include the following Liquid variable to include the body of your email:
{{content_for_layout}} 

Generally Available Email Tags
------------------------------
{{site.name}} - All variables for the current site

Email Templates
---------------
Email templates have a fixed name. Here are the templates:

* email-contact
This email is delivered to an employee of the agency from a contact form.
You can use tags as follows:
{{title}}
{{content}}
{{...}}
These tags are the same as in blogs.

Additionally, any other custom fields from your form will be available in the collection:
{{custom.fieldname}}
