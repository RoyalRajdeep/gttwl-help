DYNAMIC DATA TAGS
=================

In some cases you want to get the 3 most recent blogs, or the most recent testimonials.

You can do that with our new dynamic collection tag.

SYNTAX
=======
{% collection [name of collection], filter:value, filter:value, filter:value,....%}

EXAMPLES
========

Get the last 3 blog posts:
{% collection blogs, limit:3, order:created_at desc %}

Get a random testimonial:
{% collection testimonials, limit:1, order:random %}

Get products in the business category:
{% collection products, limit:10, order:created_at desc, category:business %}

Get products from a dynamic parameter passed into the URL
example:
http://mycoolsite.com/nice?category=fun
{% collection products, limit:10, order:created_at desc, tag:params.tag %}

Get records created by the currently logged in user
example:
{% collection blogs, limit:10, order:created_at desc, user:current_user.username %}

Use an alternate name for the generated collection
example:
{% collection blogs limit:10, name:recent_blogs %}

then
{% for blog in recent_blogs %}
  {{blog.title}}
{% end %}

USING THE COLLECTION
====================

Once you have generated the collection, you can start to use its data like:
