CREATING A NEW COMMENT
======================

You can attach a comment to any kind of post with this API.

API Endpoints

Create a comment
/api/comment/create

/api/post/destroy

AUTHENTICATION
==============
Only logged in users can create comments.
You are also able to enable new users to both create a comment and signup simultaneously by adding an "email" and "name" field to the comment form.

ALLOWED COMMENT FIELDS
======================

* zid (zid of the post you are attachign the comment to)
  parent_id (parent_id of a comment you are replying to)
* content
  content_format (text, html)
  user_zid or current_user or email and name (authentication)
  attachments[]
  
If the user is already logged in you really need only two fields to add a comment:
* zid
* content

Other fields to control processing
-----------------------------------
  success_url (url to go to after successfully creating the post)
  failure_url (url to redirect to if post failed)
  failure_template (template to render if fails)
  success_template (template to render if success)
  callback (calls a javascript function to take some kind of action named in "callback") This is useful if you post from an iframe. Will call "my_cleanup_script(error_msg)" if there was an error, so you need to handle it.
