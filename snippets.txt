SNIPPETS
--------

Snippets are small pieces of text that you can create in the snippets area of the admin. Once you create a snippet, you can include it in the template like so:

{{snippet 'name'}}

Additionally, you can include any kind of content you create like blogs etc by doing this:

{{snippet 'id:123-3453465-242423'}}

Where "123-3453465-242423" is the id of a blog, product, or any other piece of content in your admin.
The second form only pulls out the content area of your post.
