SNIPPETS
--------

Snippets are small pieces of text that you can create in 
the snippets area of the admin. 

Once you create a snippet, you can include it in the template like so:

{{snippet 'name'}}

Additionally, you can include any kind of content
you create like blogs etc by doing this:

{{snippet 'id:123-3453465-242423'}}

Where "123-3453465-242423" is the id of a blog, product, or any other piece of content in your admin.
The second form only pulls out the content area of your post.

GETTING THE ID
--------------
Extract the ID of a piece of content you are editing. 
For example, if the URL in your admin area looks like this
while you're editing the content:

https://app.travelagencytribes.com/admin/content/update/31bdz659-a1bf-4775-9f86-61dd4d342e91

To display the content you'd use this:

{{snippet 'id:31bdz659-a1bf-4775-9f86-61dd4d342e91'}}
