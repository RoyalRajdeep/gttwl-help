Collections can be filtered by passing in certain parameters to their page.

Example:
/collection?filter=value

Filters:
tag: a tag to filter by
category: a category permalink
place: the name of a place. Will find the place and filter by this exact name
near: the name of a place. Will find items in the collection close to this place
place_id: the exact id of a place, eg: 451
place_id: the exact permalink of a place. eg: paris_france
country: a country code to search on. Eg: "US"

MARKING AS OPENED IN AN EMAIL
=============================

Most kinds of public posts (blogs, products, etc) should be marked as opened. 
We have a special attribute to deal with this:
{{open_link}}

In an email:
<img src="{{post.open_link}}" height="1" width="1" />

The on-page analytics already takes care of this automatically on web pages.
